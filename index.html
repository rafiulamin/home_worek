<p> He is Allah; there is no Allah but He, He is the Knower of the unseen and the visible; He is the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. He is Allah, there is no Allah but He. He is the King, the All-Holy, the All-Peace, the Guardian of Faith, the All-Preserver, the All-Mighty, the All-Compeller, the All-Sublime. Glory be to Allah, above that they associate! He is Allah the Creator, the Maker, the Shaper. To Him belong the Names Most Beautiful. All that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies Him; He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. </p>
